# Service lifetime

Service lifetime is the total time for a service starting from the time it has been requested up till it is disposed of.

The lifetime of a service can be either

- Transient

- Scoped

- Singleton

## Singleton

Singleton lifetime services are created The first time they're requested which means the same instance will be returned for each subsequent request.

Singleton services are created only one time per container, aka `ServiceProvider`. for instance, a `RootServiceProvider` will be created implictly at app startup which will holds the singletons.
Creating new `ServiceProvider` will lead to have different instances of a singleton service.

The sample app demonstrates the difference between using the root service provider and custom one

```typescript
import { Injector, ServiceCollection, ServiceProvider } from "tiny-injector";

// Service Type
class Operation {}

// Implictly it uses the root service provider
Injector.AddSingleton(Operation);

const dedicatedServiceCollection = new ServiceCollection();
dedicatedServiceCollection.AddSingleton(Operation);

const dedicatedServiceProvider =
	dedicatedServiceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();
console.log(
	Injector.GetRequiredService(Operation) ===
		dedicatedServiceProvider.GetRequiredService(Operation)
	// Will log false, because Operation have been requested from a different service provider
);

// or you can user the Of method to build the service provider internally
// worth mention that the same service provider will be used for the same serviceCollection instance
console.log(
	Injector.GetRequiredService(Operation) ===
		Injector.Of(dedicatedServiceCollection).GetRequiredService(Operation)
);
```

Check the _Architecture_ section to learn more.

When scope validation is enabled you cannot inject either Transient or Scoped service.

## Transient

Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested.

if a transient service used in scoped service, it will be disposed along with scoped service which implies that, the Transient will live as long as the Scoped service lives.

## Scoped

Scoped services are created once per context.

Scoped objects are the same for each context but different across each context.

Context is special object that usually will be created with each web request when using routing framework such as `express.js`

## Scope validation

1. Using Scoped or Transient service in a Singleton service will eventually be singleton since singleton service will be available througot the application lifetime which leads to [**Captive Dependency**](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/06/02/captive-dependency/), when occured, `LifestyleMismatchException` will be thrown.

2. Injecting Scoped service in Transient service will require context to resolve the Transient service, if no context provided, `LifestyleMismatchException` will be thrown.

Look at _Configuration_ section to disable this behaviour.

## Example

To demonstrate the difference between service lifetimes and their registration options,
consider the following abstractions that represent an operation with an identifier, `operationId`.
Depending on how the lifetime of an operation's service is configured for the following abstractions, the `Injector` provides
either the same or different instances of the service when requested:

```typescript
abstract class AbstractOperation {
	abstract operationId: number;
}

abstract class AbstractOperationTransient extends AbstractOperation {}
abstract class AbstractOperationScoped extends AbstractOperation {}
abstract class AbstractOperationSingleton extends AbstractOperation {}
```

The following Operation class implements `AbstractOperation` then generates a random number and stores in in the `operationId` property:

```typescript
class Operation extends AbstractOperation {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.operationId = Math.random();
	}
}
```

The following code creates multiple registrations of the Operation class according to the named lifetimes:

```typescript
Injector.AddTransient(AbstractOperationTransient, Operation);
Injector.AddScoped(AbstractOperationScoped, Operation);
Injector.AddSingleton(AbstractOperationSingleton, Operation);
```

The sample demonstrates transient lifetime when being requested multiple times.
requesting `AbstractOperationTransient` multiple times will results in constructing new instance each time

```typescript
const firstOperationTransient = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationTransient
);
const secondOperationTransient = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationTransient
);

console.log(firstOperationTransient.operationId);
console.log(secondOperationTransient.operationId);
// operationId from differnet instances won't be the same due to the transient lifetime.
console.log(
	firstOperationTransient.operationId === secondOperationTransient.operationId
	// Will log "false"
);
```

The sample demonstrates scoped lifetime when being requested multiple times.
requesting `AbstractOperationScoped` multiple times will results in returning the same instance for a giving context

```typescript
const context = Injector.Create();

const firstOperationScoped = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationScoped,
	context
);
const secondOperationScoped = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationScoped,
	context
);

console.log(firstOperationScoped.operationId);
console.log(secondOperationScoped.operationId);
// operationId will equal since the same instance is returning, because we used the same context in each requeest
console.log(
	firstOperationScoped.operationId === secondOperationScoped.operationId
	// Will log "true"
);
```

The sample demonstrates scoped lifetime when being requested multiple times but for different contexts.

```typescript
const firstContext = Injector.Create();
const secondContext = Injector.Create();

const firstOperationScoped = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationScoped,
	firstContext
);
const secondOperationScoped = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationScoped,
	secondContext
);

console.log(firstOperationScoped.operationId);
console.log(secondOperationScoped.operationId);
// operationId will not equal since the different instance returned, because we used different context in each requeest
console.log(
	firstOperationScoped.operationId === secondOperationScoped.operationId
	// Will log "false"
);
```

The sample demonstrates singleton lifetime when being requested multiple times.
requesting `AbstractOperationSingleton` multiple times will results in returning the same instance

```typescript
const firstOperationSingleton = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationSingleton
);
const secondOperationSingleton = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	AbstractOperationSingleton
);

console.log(firstOperationSingleton.operationId);
console.log(secondOperationSingleton.operationId);
// operationId will be the same since it is the same instance.
console.log(
	firstOperationSingleton.operationId === secondOperationSingleton.operationId
	// Will log "true"
);
```

## Summary

- **Transient** objects are always different. The transient `operationId` value is different in each instance.
- **Scoped** objects are the same for a given context but differ across each new context.
- **Singleton** objects are the same everytime.
- The default container is `RootServiceProvider`
- Do not resolve a scoped service from a singleton and be careful not to do so indirectly, for example, through a transient service. It may cause the service to have incorrect state when processing subsequent requests. It's fine to:

  - Resolve a singleton service from a scoped or transient service.
  - Resolve a scoped service from another scoped or transient service.
