# Using Dependency Injection

## Injecting A Service

### Injecting single service

1. Declare service and decorate it with `@Injectable()`.
2. Specify lifetime.
3. Define it as parameter in class constructor.

```typescript
@Injectable()
abstract class Logger {}

@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger {}

@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(private informativeLogger: InformativeLogger) {}
}
Injector.AddSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AddSingleton(Application);
```

### Injecting Array of service type

```typescript
abstract class Logger {}

@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger {}

@Injectable()
class WarningLogger {}

@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger[]) {}
}

Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, WarningLogger);
Injector.AddSingleton(Application);
```

The sample declares `Logger` abstract class and register it as Singleton with two concrete implementation.

The `@Inject` decorator is required to get array of implementations for a service type but also you have to make sure that the type of parameter is Array as `Logger[]` or `Array<Logger>`

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger) {}
}
```

if the array type omitted the last registered implementation will be returned.

### Injecting context

In case you don't have the service added yet, you can inject the `Context` serviceType to later use it to locate the deferred service

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Test {}

@Injectable()
class Service {
	constructor(private context: Context) {
		// Calling `this.someMethod()` here will throw an error since Test serviceType is not added yet.

		// Supposedly, the Test service will be added before two seconds
		setTimeout(() => {
			Injector.AddSingleton(Test);
			this.someMethod();
		}, 2000);
	}

	someMethod() {
		return context.get(Test);
	}
}
```

Another case where you use service locator to locate a service

## Locating A Service

Singleton and Scoped lifetimes are bound to a context.

For Singleton there's a context that is used internally, but for Scoped service you have to create them yourself.

### Singleton

```typescript
@Injectable()
class SingletonService {}
Injector.AddSingleton(SingletonService);

const service = Injector.GetRequiredService(SingletonService);
```

### Scoped

Scoped is more like Singleton but for an explict context, so you need to create a context and provide it.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class ScopedService {}
Injector.AddScoped(ScopedService);

const context = Injector.Create();
const scopedService1 = Injector.GetRequiredService(ScopedService, context);
const scopedService2 = Injector.GetRequiredService(ScopedService, context); // return the same instance as above, scopedService1 === scopedService2

const secondContext = Injector.Create();
const scopedService3 = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	ScopedService,
	secondContext
); // will return new instance
```

Don't forgot to destroy the context when you done using it.

```typescript
Injector.Destroy(context);
```

### Transient

```typescript
@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class TransientService {
	constructor() {}
}

const transientService = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService);
```

In case you did inject a _Scoped_ service into a _Transient_ service, you'll have to provide context, otherwise `LifestyleMismatchException` will be thrown.

this happens due to the fact that _Scoped_ service created once per context and _Transient_ service are created each time is requested, hence without context you'll have different instance for the _Scoped_ service within the _Transient_ service so providing a context will make sure that the same scoped service is returned regardless of how many times the _Transient_ service created.

```typescript
@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Scoped,
})
class ScopedService {}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class TransientService {
	constructor(scopedService: ScopedService) {}
}

// Will throw an exception
const transientService = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService);

// works fine.
const context = Injector.Create();
const logger1 = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService, context);
const logger2 = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService, context);

/**
 * Now, logger1 and logger2 are different instances but,
 * logger1.scopedService and logger2.scopedService are the same
 */
```

It is always preferred to pass context with _Transient_ services to avoid an handled exceptions.

### Locating Array of the same service type

```typescript
abstract class Logger { }

@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger extends Logger { }

@Injectable()
class WarningLogger extends Logger { }

Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, WarningLogger);

Injector.GetRequiredService({serviceType: Logger, multiple: true, context: /** In case of Scoped or Transient */});
```

## Lifetime and registration options

```typescript
abstract class Operation {
	abstract operationId: string;
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class OperationTransient extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Scoped,
})
class OperationScoped extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Singleton,
})
class OperationSingleton extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(
		private transientOperation1: OperationTransient,
		private transientOperation2: OperationTransient,
		private scopedOperation1: OperationScoped,
		private scopedOperation2: OperationScoped,
		private singletonOperation: OperationSingleton
	) {}
}

const context = Injector.Create();
const app = Injector.GetRequiredService(Application, context);

console.log(
	app.transientOperation1.operationId === app.transientOperation2.operationId
); // false

console.log(
	app.scopedOperation1.operationId === app.scopedOperation2.operationId
); // true
```

- Transient objects are always different. transientOperation2 is not the same as transientOperation1.

- Scoped objects are the same for each context but different across each context.

- Singleton objects are the same for every context.

## Summary

- `@Injectable` is required on top of each service even if you don't use it to register a service.

- Once you add service you cannot override it and an error will be throw if you tried to do.

- If you want to override a service you have to use `Injector.Replace{Lifetime}` instead.

- A service will only be created when requested with respect to a service lifetime.

- You would use `Append{Lifetime}` to have multiple implementation for the same service type.

- Use `@Inject` to resolve multiple implementations with array type, `@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger[]`.

- `@Inject` is optional to resolve single implementation.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(
		private logger: Logger,
		// Shorthand for
		@Inject(Logger) private logger: Logger
	) {}
}
```

- Last implementation will always returned if you don't use array type.

- Inject `Context` to resolve deferred dependencies.
