# Using Dependency Injection

If you recall from the [ServiceRegistration](./ServiceRegistration) page, you can have

- One to one relation: one ServiceType to one ImplementationType
- Many to one: one ServiceType to many ImplementationTypes

In this page we're gonna learn how to be able to request them back!
To request a `ServiceType` you can either use **class constructor** or `Service Locator Pattern`

> Any class that is utilzing the DI should have the `@Injectable()` so it can be part of the play!.

## Constructor parameters

```typescript
// Abstract Service
@Injectable()
abstract class Logger {}

// Concrete Service
@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger extends Logger {}

// Client
@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(private logger: Logger) {}
}

Injector.AddSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AddSingleton(Application);
```

In the previous sample the `Application` class declared the abstract `Logger` as dependence.
the `Logger` class have `InformativeLogger` as implementation type which implies that the `InformativeLogger` will
be injected in the `Application` class. that's due the registration of `InformativeLogger` against `Logger`

Same case with requesting multiple `ImplementationTypes` from the same `ServiceType`

```typescript
abstract class Logger {}

@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger extends Logger {}

@Injectable()
class WarningLogger extends Logger {}

@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger[]) {}
}

Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, WarningLogger);
Injector.AddSingleton(Application);
```

In the previous sample the `Application` class declared the abstract `Logger` as dependence but with array type instead of the abstraction
and with `@Inject` decorator.

> This is required to know that your intention is to have array of implementations.

The `Logger` class have `InformativeLogger` and `WarningLogger` as implementations which implies that the both `InformativeLogger` and `WarningLogger` will
be injected in the `Application` class as array type.
that's due the registration of `InformativeLogger` and `WarningLogger` against `Logger`

> The `@Inject` decorator is required to get array of implementations for a service type but also you have to make sure that the type of parameter is Array as `Logger[]` or `Array<Logger>`

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger) {}
}
```

Important: **If the array type omitted the last registered implementation will be returned**.

## Service Locator Pattern

Singleton and Scoped lifetimes are bound to a context.

For Singleton there's a context that is used internally, but for Scoped service you have to create them yourself.

### Singleton

```typescript
@Injectable()
class SingletonService {}
Injector.AddSingleton(SingletonService);

const service = Injector.GetRequiredService(SingletonService);
```

### Scoped

Scoped is more like Singleton but for an explict context, so you need to create a context and provide it.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class ScopedService {}
Injector.AddScoped(ScopedService);

const context = Injector.Create();
const scopedService1 = Injector.GetRequiredService(ScopedService, context);
const scopedService2 = Injector.GetRequiredService(ScopedService, context); // return the same instance as above, scopedService1 === scopedService2

const secondContext = Injector.Create();
const scopedService3 = Injector.GetRequiredService(
	ScopedService,
	secondContext
); // will return new instance
```

Don't forgot to destroy the context when you done using it.

```typescript
Injector.Destroy(context);
```

### Transient

```typescript
@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class TransientService {
	constructor() {}
}

const transientService = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService);
```

In case you did inject a _Scoped_ service into a _Transient_ service, you'll have to provide context, otherwise `LifestyleMismatchException` will be thrown.

this happens due to the fact that _Scoped_ service created once per context and _Transient_ service are created each time is requested, hence without context you'll have different instance for the _Scoped_ service within the _Transient_ service so providing a context will make sure that the same scoped service is returned regardless of how many times the _Transient_ service created.

```typescript
@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Scoped,
})
class ScopedService {}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class TransientService {
	constructor(scopedService: ScopedService) {}
}

// Will throw an exception
const transientService = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService);

// works fine.
const context = Injector.Create();
const logger1 = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService, context);
const logger2 = Injector.GetRequiredService(TransientService, context);

/**
 * Now, logger1 and logger2 are different instances but,
 * logger1.scopedService and logger2.scopedService are the same
 */
```

It is always preferred to pass context with _Transient_ services to avoid an handled exceptions.

### Locating Array of the same service type

```typescript
abstract class Logger {}

@Injectable()
class InformativeLogger extends Logger {}

@Injectable()
class WarningLogger extends Logger {}

Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, InformativeLogger);
Injector.AppendSingleton(Logger, WarningLogger);

const loggers = Injector.GetServices(Logger);
```

## Lifetime and registration options

```typescript
abstract class Operation {
	abstract operationId: string;
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Transient,
})
class OperationTransient extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Scoped,
})
class OperationScoped extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Singleton,
})
class OperationSingleton extends Operation {
	operationId = Math.random().toString(36);
}

@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(
		private transientOperation1: OperationTransient,
		private transientOperation2: OperationTransient,
		private scopedOperation1: OperationScoped,
		private scopedOperation2: OperationScoped,
		private singletonOperation: OperationSingleton
	) {}
}

const context = Injector.Create();
const app = Injector.GetRequiredService(Application, context);

console.log(
	app.transientOperation1.operationId === app.transientOperation2.operationId
); // false

console.log(
	app.scopedOperation1.operationId === app.scopedOperation2.operationId
); // true
```

- Transient objects are always different. transientOperation2 is not the same as transientOperation1.

- Scoped objects are the same for each context but different across each context.

- Singleton objects are the same for every context.

## Summary

- `@Injectable` is required on top of each service even if you don't use it to register a service.

- Once you add service you cannot override it and an error will be throw if you tried to do.

- If you want to override a service you have to use `Injector.Replace{Lifetime}` instead.

- A service will only be created when requested with respect to a service lifetime.

- You would use `Append{Lifetime}` to have multiple implementation for the same service type.

- Use `@Inject` to resolve multiple implementations with array type, `@Inject(Logger) private loggers: Logger[]`.

- `@Inject` is optional to resolve single implementation.

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Application {
	constructor(
		private logger: Logger,
		// Shorthand for
		@Inject(Logger) private logger: Logger
	) {}
}
```

- Last implementation will always returned if you don't use array type.

- Inject `Context` to resolve deferred dependencies.
