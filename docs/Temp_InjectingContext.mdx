## Injecting A Context

Let's say we have this code

```typescript
@Injectable({
	lifetime: ServiceLifetime.Scoped,
})
class Logger {}

const context = Injector.Create();
const logger = Injector.GetRequiredService(Logger, context);

Injector.Destroy(context);
```

In case you don't have the service added yet, you can inject the `Context` serviceType to later use it to locate the deferred service

```typescript
@Injectable()
class Test {}

@Injectable()
class Service {
	constructor(private context: Context) {
		// Calling `this.someMethod()` here will throw an error since Test serviceType is not added yet.

		// Supposedly, the Test service will be added before two seconds
		setTimeout(() => {
			Injector.AddSingleton(Test);
			this.someMethod();
		}, 2000);
	}

	someMethod() {
		return context.get(Test);
	}
}
```

Another case where you use service locator to locate a service
